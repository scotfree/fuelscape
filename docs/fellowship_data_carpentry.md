# An Age of (Open) Data

* Reading & Writing used to be a Profession. So did Data Science.
* Data and Data Tools publicly available in astounding ways.
* Scientists, policymakers, and citizens now use many of the same tools.

# The Tools are Free(-ish) and Easy(-ish)

* Jupyter Notebooks and Google Colab let anyone write and run code in a browser.
* The notebook model lets you work from examples not write code.
* Don't forget Google Sheets and the massive ecosystem around them.
* Put some data in AWS S3 and be amazed! There's an analysis ecosystem already pointed at it!

# The data is mostly free

* AWS public data sets, Overture, OSM
* Planet Labs & others have non-profit access to commercial data

# Use AI Well
      
* Not talking about: specific ML & ANNs, AI for creative work
* AI to make tools not analyze data - less waste and hallucination
* Make AI ask YOU questions.
* Cautionary Tale: Board Game Rules
* Use AI to get you over the "energy barrier" for trying new things, not to do the work
