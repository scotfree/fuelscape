# Empower Yourself With Data!

* Reading & Writing used to be a Profession. So did Data Science.
* Data and Data Tools publicly available in astounding ways.
* Scientists, policymakers, and citizens now use many of the same tools.

# Interesting and Open Data

Not a comprehensive list but some places to get started and a glimpse at the depth and breadth of modern Open Data.

* types and formats
  * tab data and spreadsheets
    * geospatial data: vectors and rasters
    * other
* examples and starting points
  * environmental and societal
    * https://data.humdata.org
    * https://jeiloh.github.io/esip_dlc_trusted_data/
    * Public, open-access data from NASA, NOAA, Copernicus, USGS, and many others.
    * [NASA](data.nasa.gov) hosts an incredible variety of climate-relevant datasets.
  * maps
    * [Overture]()
    * Open Street Map
      * [Simple Maps](https://www.openstreetmap.org/search?query=rare+earth+mine&zoom=9&minlon=-117.60864257812501&minlat=34.30260622622907&maxlon=-113.40362548828126&maxlat=36.41686211530033#map=17/35.503225/-115.511230)
      * ([Turbi and Overpass](https://overpass-turbo.eu)
    * [OpenTopography](https://portal.opentopography.org/datasets) for landform and elevation data.
  * huge and technical
    * [AWS Open Data](https://registry.opendata.aws)
    * Planet Labs for non-profits
    * [NOAA](https://www.noaa.gov/information-technology/open-data-dissemination) uses cloud platforms

# Useful and Open Tools



* Free Athena Overture access in AWS/S3
* Notebooks
  * Jupyter Notebooks and Google Colab let anyone write and run code in a browser.
  * The notebook model lets you work from examples not write code. 
* DuckDB
* geojson.io and felt.com
  * export data from OSM or USGS 
* Don't forget Google Spreadsheets & friends - Earth/Maps, etc
  * ex: spreadsheet linked to map
* Put some data in AWS S3 and be amazed! There's an analysis ecosystem already pointed at it!
  * example: [Overture](https://docs.overturemaps.org/getting-data/)

# Opening PandorAI's box
* Not talking about: specific ML & ANNs, AI for creative work
  * Try to make tools not answers
    * AI to make tools not analyze data - less waste and hallucination
* Have it Ask You Questions      
* Cautionary Tale: Board Game Rules
* Use AI to get you over the "energy barrier" for trying new things, not to do the work
