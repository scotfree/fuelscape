# Gamifying Biochar Prodution in Wildfile Fuel Reduction

* Connunity Wildfire Fuel reduction is a thing.
* Producing biochar can be a great way to do that thing.
* It can also not. It's hard for non-experts to know!
* Being able to game out different treatment plans in terms of cost, emissions, time, and risk would be cool.

# A Simple Scenario

A hill with some trees on it that we'd like to de-risk.

* Some are close to roads and a creek
* Some are not
* parts of the hill are steep.

# Where to place biochar production sites?

Many models consider a treatment area as the sum of its parts with no geometry.

* Biochar production should be close to water to quench (and for safety)
* If we're going to move the biochar we should be close to a road
* Being closer to trees is more efficient - but not too close!
* Some production techniques are easier to move around than others.

# Some production sites are better than toerhs

* some fuels may not be suited to biochar production at all
* use and transport of the biochar effects where it should be produced
* different areas can have different best answers
