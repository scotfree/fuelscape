# Biochar in Wildfire Resilience

Game out different treatment plans in terms of cost, emissions, time, and risk.

* Community Wildfire Fuel reduction is important.
* Producing biochar can be a great technique.
* It can also not be. How can regular folks explore the options?!

# A Simple Scenario

A hill with some trees on it that we'd like to de-risk.

* Some fuels are close to roads and a creek
* Some are not!
* Parts of the hill are steep.

# Biochar processing site placement

Many models consider a treatment area as the sum of its parts with no geometry.

* Biochar production needs water to "quench".
* Transporting the biochar requires road access - some kilns too.
* Being closer to trees is more efficient - but not too close!

# Location, Location, Location

* some fuels may not be suited to biochar production at all
* use and transport of the biochar affects where it should be produced
* different areas can have different best answers

# Start with Community Data

* Map data from Community or Open Sources
* Roads, Water Sources, Topography, Buildings
* Local Requirements

# Sketch a Treatment Plan

* Plans can be imported from practitioners
* Or created using web app tools
* Should be light and iterative but Precise and Open

# $



* A treatment plan is scored along multiple axes
* Radar graphs allow comparison
* Output to Practitioners - or Grant documents, spreadsheets, maps
